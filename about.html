                <p class="p">
                    At the time of writing this I am 16 years old, I'll be 17 October of this year, tho i could
                    forget to update the website, so to make it easier I was born in 2006.
                    I live in Italy, and chose a scientific school address as my "high school".
                    Actually, if I knew about my coding passion before making that choice, I would have probably
                    chosen a scientific school address with extra science (no latin, added informatics).<br>
                    I don't know what I'll do after school, but I'll probably go to university. Who knows, maybe
                    programming now will help me in university (if I choose computer science) and get me a 
                    job, just sayin.
                    I played the piano in middle school, but dropped it as soon as i passed the exam.<br>
                    I'm Italian so i despise the French. I eat pizza, pasta and mandolini (just kidding, i never
                    saw a mandolino in real life). I despise Unreal Engine (I could have already said that) and make
                    fun of love2D and Godot users (always kidding (sometimes not)). <br>
                    I like physics and math. I don't like school tho.

                <p class="p">
                    I started my programming journey when the pandemic started, 2020. My first approach to programming
                    was with some random useless sites, even tho i basically only used HTML and left CSS and JavaScript
                    to boostrap. Then I got more curious and followed tutorials using Django. Did I understand something?
                    Of course not. <br> After i got burned out from web development i searched for a safe place in other coding
                    aspects inevitably falling into game developement, still my main focus nowadays. I followed some tutorials
                    at first, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode" class="plum-link">Clear Code</a> 
                    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss" class="plum-link">Coding With Russ</a> 
                    (They helped me a ton) and then started not to rely on tutorials and make things on my own. 
                    That's when I improved the most.<br> When i was kinda good in python
                    I also started developing with Unity, which i still enojoy and that has taught me a lot more OOP concepts
                    (I am OOP addicted). <br>And then we arrive to now, when I can say I am a decent C# and Unity developer
                    and a pro Python and pygame developer.

                    <li><p>Don't rely solely on tutorials, use them to learn the basics and then start
