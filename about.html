                <p class="p">
                    I am Damus or Damiano, I was born in October 2006, I live in Italy. I chose a scientific "high school" 
                    as my school path. If I had known before about my passion for coding I would probably have chosen the 
                    scientific school with extra science (No latin but added Informatics).<br> I do not currently know what I 
                    will be doing after school, but I will likely go to university. Maybe programming will help me later 
                    in life. I had played the piano but stopped after I passed the exam in middle school. <br>
                    I'm Italian so I despise the French. I eat pizza, pasta and mandolini (just kidding, I never
                    saw a mandolino in real life). I despise Unreal Engine (I could have already said that) and make
                    fun of love2D and Godot users (always kidding (sometimes not)). <br>
                    I like physics and math. I don't like school tho.

                    I started my programming journey when the pandemic started, 2020. My first approach to programming
                    was with some random useless sites, even tho i basically only used HTML and left CSS and JavaScript
                    to boostrap.<br> Then I got more curious and followed tutorials using Django. Did I understand something?
                    Of course not. <br> After i got burned out from web development i searched for a safe place in other coding
                    aspects inevitably falling into game developement, still my main focus nowadays.<br> I followed some tutorials
                    at first, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode" class="plum-link">Clear Code</a> 
                    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss" class="plum-link">Coding With Russ</a> 
                    (They helped me a ton) and then started not to rely on tutorials and make things on my own. 
                    That's when I improved the most.<br> When I was kinda good in python
                    I also started developing with Unity, which I still enojoy and that has taught me a lot more OOP concepts
                    (I am OOP addicted). <br>And then we arrive to now, when I can say I am a decent C# and Unity developer
                    and a pro Python and pygame developer.

                    <li><p>Don't rely solely on tutorials, use them to learn the basics and then start
