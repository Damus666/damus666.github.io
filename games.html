                <p class="p">
                    I currently make games mainly as a hobby. It's fun and fills time. I also improve
                    my general coding skill by doing so. I was inspired to make games when i got curious about
                    how other games worked, so i tried to make my own. I started as a noob following
                    tutorials and i'm still learning a lot about game design and structure.
                    In the future, especially when I'll be 18 i might consider making games for a bit of money.

                    <b>Pygame</b></a>:
                    the first language i learned was python, so by logic the first game attempts have been
                    using the <i>clearly best</i> game library for python: pygame. Even if it has no user interface
                    or complex functionality built-in like a game engine i still enjoy it a lot thanks to the
                    control it gives me over my code and thanks to the dynamic style of python.
                    Recently i also switched to pygame-ce, the <i>clearly better</i> version of the two.

                    <b>Unity Engine</b></a>:
                    after python i got to the C# language, my personal favourite so i started using Unity.
                    the differences against pygame are immense, and it's technically "better" but it's actually
                    preference based on the user needs. One is a game engine, the other is a game framework. 
                    Personally i like them both, mainly thanks to their differences.
                    Also Unity is best know for its 3D while pygame for 2D, so they complement each other.
