                <p class="p">
                    I am currently making games mainly as a hobby. It's fun and fills time. I also improve
                    my general coding skill by doing so.<br> I was inspired to make games when i got curious about
                    how other games worked, so I tried to make my own. I started as a noob following
                    tutorials and I'm still learning a lot about game design and structure.<br>
                    In the future, especially when I'll be 18 I might consider making games for a bit of money.

                    <b>Pygame</b></a>:
                    the first language I learned was python, so obviously for my first game attempts I used the 
                    <i>clearly best</i> game library for python: Pygame. <br>Even if it has no user interface
                    or complex functionality built-in like a game engine I still enjoy it a lot thanks to the
                    control it gives me over my code and thanks to the dynamic style of python.<br>
                    Recently I also switched to pygame-ce, the <i>clearly better</i> version of the two.

                    <b>Unity Engine</b></a>:
                    after python I got to the C# language, my personal favourite so I started using Unity.<br>
                    the differences against pygame are immense, and it's technically "better" but it's actually
                    preference based on the user needs. One is a game engine, the other is a game framework. 
                    Personally I like them both, mainly thanks to their differences.<br>
                    Also Unity is best know for its 3D while pygame for 2D, so they complement each other.

                            I made those cus I had an inspiration/was bored. They are prototypes because they don't have any game loop. 
                            <br>For the simulation game
                            it's fun to see how bacteria-like life evolve during its lifetime. The simulation is not that complex, I saw incredible
                            things on YouTube. One thing that made me stop was also the performace, how can other people's simulations run so well!<br>
                            Instead in the universe explorer you just wonder around, realising how little you are. I have an unpublished prototype where
                            the space background is way nicer, but it's not lost as I've put it in Auto Planet.
