                <p class="p">As I said I'm also a programmer: Even tho games are mainly code, I don't make just games.
                    I sometimes have ideas for some things that aren't games.<br> My favourite languages
                    are Python and C#. I made only one real project with C#, I solely used it for games, instead I've made
                    plenty of projects with python, probably because it's easier and more accessible. <br>Most of them still rotate
                    around the pygame library somehow, but there are a few that don't. <br><br>
                    You can find all the projects I'll be listing and more in <a href="https://github.com/Damus666?tab=repositories" class="plum-link">my github repositories</a>.

                    <li class="p">
                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/Damuscript" target="_blank" class="plum-link">Damuscript</a>: 
                        I finally done what I've always wished to do: A feature complete programming language.<br>
                        It's interpreted in python and has an API to add features to it. Not the best in terms
                         of performance, but at least I managed to make it. 
                    </li><br>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/Solace" target="_blank" class="plum-link">Solace</a>: 
                        Damuscript predecessor, a way less complex programming language. The base is
                         from a tutorial, that's why I wasn't able
                        to expand it as I would have liked. Damuscript solves all its issues.

                <h2 class="h">Libraries</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="p">
                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/PGPU" target="_blank" class="plum-link">PGPU (Pygame GPU Accelerated Engine)</a>: 
                        The library I'm more proud of is for sure PGPU. <br>It's a engine wrapper for the pygame
                         _sdl2 module, still in developement, which let you use your GPU. I was inspired by 
                         the Unity Component System  for the engine structure.
                    </li><br>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/DamGUI" target="_blank" class="plum-link">DamGUI</a>: 
                        A pygame library containing various UI components. The structure is inspired by ImGUI,
                         that's why I like it a lot. The code is super messy tho, so I might rewrite the 
                         whole library.
                    </li><br>
                    <li class="p">
                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/pygameUI" target="_blank" class="plum-link">pygameUI</a>: 
                        An older UI library than DamGUI. I don't think it's inferior tho, as it has a completely different structure.<br>
                        In fact, it uses python object to describe UI components, instead of runtime function calling. Might even be faster,
                        but it depends on the user preference to use one or another.
                    </li><br>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/PGBoost" target="_blank" class="plum-link">PGBoost</a> and 
                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/new_pygame_helper" class="plum-link">pygame_helper</a>:
                        Both are pygame libraries that should help developing games. They are not great tho imo, I think PGPU is better
                        under any point of view.

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/DamEngine" target="_blank" class="plum-link">C# Engine</a>: 
                        An attempt of a game engine in C# using SDL2, inspired by pygame. It's my only uploaded C#
                        project, and I think PGPU is better than this.
                    </li><br>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/JsonHelper" target="_blank" class="plum-link">Json Helper</a>: 
                        A python module that converts JSON strings into a set of python objects, to manage the JSON
                        easly. It also contains a bunch of utility functions and classes. Pretty neat.

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/TileKit" target="_blank" class="plum-link">Tile Kit</a>: 
                        A not so good but decent level editor featuring tiles and objects plus some tools and saving/loading.
                        I could make a better one, for now I got this tho, and it's powered by pygameUI.
                    </li><br>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/GraphWizard" target="_blank" class="plum-link">Graph Wizard</a>: 
                        A graphic calculator able to render any function into a XY plane. It's powered by pygame and pygameUI,
                        Performance can drop easly. It also support variables and sliders. I should probably make it in Unity.
                    </li><br>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/DSlides" target="_blank" class="plum-link">DSlides</a>: 
                        A Powerpoint inspired presentation maker. The UI is powered by pygameUI. Even has its own presentation
                        file language, to easly edit it without the editor. Of course it's not even close to Powerpoint complexity,
                        But still a nice lightweight tool.

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/Clicky" target="_blank" class="plum-link">Clicky</a>: 
                        A super simple and stupid autoclicker. It's powered by DamGUI tho! And that's the only
                        reason why it exist, I wanted to test the library.
                    </li><br>

                        <a href="https://github.com/Damus666/DamPad" target="_blank" class="plum-link">DamPad</a>: 
                        Very simple note and book editor made using customtkinter. Really I was just testing the UI framework,
                        but it ended up a neat program.
